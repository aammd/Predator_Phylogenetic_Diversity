## Introduction

Predators can have strong top-down effects, both on community structure and
ecosystem processes [@Estes2011]. The combined effect of predator species on communities is often stronger or weaker than that predicted from a study of those same species in isolation [@Sih1998a;@Ives2005]. These non-additive effects occur when predators interact with each other directly, or
via their shared prey species. For example, predators feed directly on each
other (intra-guild predation), consume the same prey (resource competition) or
modify the behaviour of prey or the other predator species [@Sih1998a;@Griswold2006;@Nystrom2001]. These non-additive effects can be positive or negative. For example, prey may have an induced defense against one predator which increases (negative non-additive effect) or decreases (positive non-additive effect) the likelihood of consumption by a second predator. While there are many possible mechanisms underlying the effect of predator composition, we lack a means of
predicting _a priori_ the strength and direction of this effect on community structure and ecosystem function.

Phylogenetic diversity could provide a framework for making these predictions about combined effects of predators. Phylogenetic diversity extends the measurement of diversity to include the evolutionary relationships between species. Two closely related species may be similar ecologically; two distant species might be very different. Very similar species may compete strongly, and/or may interfere with each other while very different species may not be able to occur in the same patch. This approach was first used to interpret observations of community structure, as ecologists interpreted nonrandom phylogenetic structure (i.e. under- or over- dispersion) as evidence for the processes, such as habitat filtering or competition, which structure communities [@Webb2002;@Cavender-Bares2009]. Recently, this approach has been applied to manipulative experiments. For example, the phylogenetic diversity of plant
communities is a better predictor of productivity than either species
richness or diversity [e.g. @Cadotte2009;@Cadotte2008;@Godoy2014]. In all cases, an implicit
assumption is that increased phylogenetic distance is associated with
increased ecological dissimilarity -- either in the form of differences in
species niches, interactions, or functional traits. When this is true, high
phylogenetic diversity should lead to complementarity in resource use between species, resulting in increased
ecosystem functioning [@Srivastava2012c]. For example, studies of plants have shown that in both experimental [@Cadotte2008] and natural communities [], ecosystem function in plant communities is positively related to the phylogenetic diversity of plants. Although there have been many studies taking a phylogenetic approach to
community ecology and although predators have large effects on many communities, the
phylogenetic diversity of local predator assemblages has rarely been measured
[@Bersier2008;@Naisbit2011]. Many studies of phylogeny and predator
traits focus on whole clades, rather than local assemblages (e.g. *Anolis*
lizards [@Knouft2006], warblers [@Bohning-Gaese2003], tree boas
[@Henderson2013] and wasps [@Udriene2005]), making it difficult to connect these
results to predator effects at the scale of a local community. These 
clade specific studies often find weak evidence for phylogenetic signal in
ecologically relevant traits. In contrast, studies at the level of the whole biosphere
[@Gomez2010;@Bersier2008] demonstrate that related organisms often have similar
interspecific interactions, i.e. related predators often consume similar prey. At the local scale, only a few studies have examined how phylogeny may shape food webs [@Rezende2009;@Cagnolo2011]; these observational studies found that models containing both relatedness (either from taxonomic rank or phylogenetic trees) and body size were better at predicting which predator-prey interactions occurred than models with body size alone. As observational studies, however, they cannot isolate if it is differences in predator distribution or diet that leads to a phylogenetic signal in predator-prey interactions, nor how these interactions affect the whole community. 

Within a local community, the effect of predator species diversity will depend on three factors: how predators are distributed among habitats, how they interact with prey, and how they interact with each other. Can phylogeny help us predict how these three factors vary among predators within a community? To the extent that phylogenetic relationships are correlated with these three factors they enable us to predict the impact of predator diversity on communities. For instance, phylogeny could constrain predator species co-occurrence if more distant phylogenetic 
relatives have more distinct fundamental niches, whereas close relatives are too
similar to co-exist [@Webb2002;@Emerson2008]. When predators do co-occur, phylogeny may correlate with their feeding behavior, such that closely related predators consume similar prey. For example, diet overlap (shared prey species between predators) will depend on the feeding traits and nutritional 
requirements of predators -- both of which may be phylogenetically conserved. If this is the case, then predator assemblages with higher
phylogenetic diversity will show a greater range of prey consumed and therefore stronger top-
down effects [@Finke2008a]. In some cases, predator
diets may extend to include other predators, leading to direct negative
interactions such as intraguild predation, which may also have a phylogenetic
signal [@Pfennig2000]. To our knowledge, the relationship of phylogeny to predator distribution, diet, and intraguild interactions has never been investigated in a single study.

We tested for effects of phylogenetic distance on distribution, diet and
interactions of predators living in a natural mesocosm: water reservoirs found inside bromeliad leaves. Bromeliads (Bromeliaceae) are flowering plants abundant in the Neotropics. Within this aquatic food
web, damselfly larvae (e.g. *Leptagrion* spp., Odonata:Coenagrionidae) are
important predators that dramatically reduce insect colonization [@Hammill2015]
and emergence [@Starzomski2010], and increase nutrient cycling [@Ngai2006].
In addition to damselfly larvae, other predators are also found in bromeliads, including large
predaceous fly larvae (Diptera: Tabanidae) and predatory leeches
(Hirudinae:Arhynchobdellida) (see Frank et al. [-@Frank2009]). 
Many bromeliads contain water and trapped, terrestrial detritus which supplies
nutrients for the bromeliad [@Reich2003a]. The small size of these habitats
permits direct manipulations of entire food webs, manipulations which would be
difficult in most natural systems. Predators have been shown to have large
top-down effects on ecosystem functions in bromelaids, including nitrogen uptake
by the plant [@Ngai2006], detrital decomposition and CO~2~ flux [@Atwood2014;
@Atwood2013].

We tested for a relationship between the distribution, diet and ecosystem effect of predators and their phylogenetic distance using observations, lab feeding trials, and manipulative field
experiments, respectively. We observed predator distribution by dissecting a sample of natural bromeliads. We quantified diet preferences in a series of no-choice feeding trials. Ecosystem-level effects were measured with a manipulative experiment, where predators were placed alone or in combination within standardized communities. In each approach, we test the hypothesis that greater phylogenetic distance correlates
with greater difference in predator impacts on the bromeliad community:

1. *Distributional similarity*: Closely related predators occur in the same habitat patch more
frequently than less related predators. Alternatively, closely related species
may never co-occur.

2. *Diet similarity*: Closely related predators will eat similar prey at similar rates.
Alternatively,  closely related species may have evolved different diets to
facilitate coexistence.

3. *Ecosystem-level effects*: We tested two sets of hypotheses about
direct and indirect effects of predator combinations on ecosystems, predicting:

    (a) Closely related predators will have similar effects on the community. This will occur if related predators have similar trophic interactions (e.g. predation rate, diet similarity). Our single-species treatments allow us to assess the effect of each predator both on prey survival and on ecosystem functions. 
    (b) Predator assemblages with higher phylogenetic diversity will have synergistic (greater than additive) effects on prey consumption and associated ecosystem functions. This will occur if phylogenetic distance correlates with increasing trait difference, and if this trait difference in turn results in niche complementarity. However, at the extreme, different predators may consume each other, thus creating antagonistic (less than additive) effects on prey consumption. By comparing treatments with pairs of predators to treatments that received each predator alone, we are able to estimate additive and non-additive effects. 

## Methods

### Study Design

We used three empirical approaches to test the hypotheses outlined above. To test hypothesis 1 (distribution) we sampled bromeliads for predator species. To test hypothesis 2 (diet similarity), we conducted a series of laboratory feeding trials. Finally, we tested hypothesis 3 (similarity of community effect and interaction) with a field experiment in which predators were added to bromeliads containing standardized communities of prey. This experiment included both single species treatments and two species treatments; the latter were chosen to create the widest possible range of phylogenetic diversity. 

We included phylogenetic information in our analyses of all three datasets. We obtained this phylogenetic information first from classification alone. Next we added information about the age of each node from "timetree.org", an online database of published  molecular time estimates
[@Hedges2006]. The timetree online database collects information from multiple independent phylogenetic studies. These studies provide independent estimates of the age of the most recent common ancestor for two lineages. Lineages that diverged a long time ago have been dated by multiple studies; for such nodes we used the median age. All internal nodes were dated by at least one study, however data was unavailable for the youngest nodes (i.e. tips) of the tree. For these nodes, either a lack of taxonomic information (e.g. Tabanidae) or a lack of
phylogenetic study (e.g. _Leptagrion_) prevented more information from being
included. These branches were left unresolved (i.e., as polytomies) and were all assigned identical, arbitrary and short branch lengths (15 Mya). The result is a phylogeny that closely resembles the qualitative, taxonomy-based tree with which we began. Because the node ages between our major predators (leeches, tabanids and odonata) are so deep, variation among studies in the estimated age of these nodes was minor compared to the differences between them.

We conducted all three experiments in Parque Estadual da Ilha do Cardoso (25^o^
03' S, 47^o^ 53' W), a 22.5 ha island off the south coast of São Paulo state,
Brazil. We worked in a coastal forest (_restinga_) with an understory dominated
by  _Quesnelia arvensis_ Mez. (Bromeliaceae). _Q. arvensis_ is a large
terrestrial bromeliad that catches and holds rainwater (phytotelmata),
accumulating up to 2.8 L of rainwater in a single plant. Our observational
survey found more than 47 species of macroinvertebrates in these aquatic
communities [@Romero2010], in `r ncol(metabolic) -1` bromeliads of various sizes.
This diversity encompasses multiple trophic and functional groups. Filter
feeders were entirely mosquito larvae (Diptera:Culicidae); detritivores include shredders
(Diptera:Tipulidae, Trichoptera:Calamoceratidae), scrapers
(Coleoptera:Scirtidae), and collectors (All Diptera:Chironomidae, Syrphidae,
Psychodidae). All these species are prey for a  diverse predator assemblage
dominated by at least three species of damselfly larvae (_Leptagrion_ spp.,
Odonata:Coenagrionidae), two species of Horse Fly larvae
(Diptera:Tabanidae), and two species of leech (Arhynchobdellida). A lower percentage of predator biomass was composed of Dytiscid larvae (Coleoptera), midge larvae (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) and chironomid larvae (Diptera: Tanypodinae).

## Data collection

### Distributional similarity

We asked whether closely related predators were found in the same bromeliads. In
2008, each bromeliad was dissected and washed to remove invertebrates. We passed this water through two sieves (150 and 850 µm), which removed
particulate organic matter without losing any invertebrates. All invertebrates
were counted and identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible. The body
length of all individuals was measured when possible for small and medium-sized
taxa (< 1cm final instar) and always for large-bodied taxa (> 1 cm final
instar).

### Diet Similarity
```{r CALC_feeding_trials}
## numbers for text
ntrials <- sum(feeding_trials$number.trials)
npred <- length(unique(feeding_trials$predator.names))
nprey <- length(unique(feeding_trials$Prey.species))
ncombos <- nrow(feeding_trials)
rep_range <- range(feeding_trials$number.trials)
```

To test whether related predators eat similar prey, we fed prey to predators in laboratory feeding trials. We conducted `r ntrials` feeding trials of `r npred` predator taxa and `r nprey` prey taxa between March and April 2011.  We  included all potential predator-prey pairs present in the experiment
(described below), and attempted to perform all other combinations whenever possible. However, due to the rarity of some taxa, many predator-prey pairs were not possible; we tested `r ncombos` pairwise combinations.  Most trials were replicated at least five times, but the number of replicates ranged from `r rep_range[[1]]` to `r rep_range[[2]]`. To conduct the trials, we placed
predators together with prey in a 50ml vial, with a stick for
substrate. The only exception was the tabanid larvae, which we
placed between two vertical surfaces to imitate the narrow space found in
bromeliad leaf axils (their preferred microhabitat, necessary for successful feeding).  Generally our trials contained a single predator and a
single prey individual, except in the case of very small prey (_Elpidium_ sp.)
or predators (_Monopelopia_ sp.) in which case we increased the density.  We recorded whether prey was consumed after 24 hours.

### Community effect experiment

Our third hypothesis had two parts: (a) how do predator species differ in their
effects on the invertebrate community and ecosystem processes and (b) do predator combinations show non-
additive effects on community and ecosystem processes, and do these non-additive effects increase or
decrease with phylogenetic distance?

#### Experimental design

We tested effects of both single and multiple predator species on community responses with a manipulative experiment where identical prey communities were exposed to treatments of either a single predator, or pairs of predators representing increasing phylogenetic diversity. In this experiment we focused on the four most abundant large predators found in
the community: _Leptagrion andromache_ and _Leptagrion elongatum_ (Odonata:
Coenagrionidae), a predatory Tabanid fly (Diptera:Tabanidae:_Stibasoma_ sp.) and
a predatory leech. We combined these species in eight treatments: predator-free
control (no predators), each of the four predator species alone (3a) and
pairs of predator species chosen to maximize variation in phylogenetic distance
(3b). Specifically, these pairs were: two congeneric damselflies
(*Leptagrion andromache* and *Leptagrion elongatum*), two insects (*L.
elongatum* and _Stibasoma_), and two invertebrates (*L. elongatum*
and a predatory leech).  We used five replicate bromeliads for each of these 8
treatments (8 treatments, n=5). This experiment, therefore, allows the estimation
of the effect of each predator species (single-species treatments), as well as the
detection of non-additive effects in predator combinations.


We created bromeliad communities that were as similar as possible to each other, and also to the average composition of a bromeliad. In February 2011 we collected bromeliads with a volume between 90 and 200ml,
thoroughly washed the plants to remove organisms and detritus, and soaked them for 12 hours in a
tub of water. We then hung all bromeliads for 48 hours to dry. This procedure was intended to remove all existing macroinvertebrates; one bromeliad dissected
afterwards contained no insects (a similar technique was used by Romero and Srivastava [-@Romero2010]). We simulated natural detritus inputs from the canopy by adding a standard mass of dried leaves of the species _Plinia cauliflora_ (Jabuticaba, Myrtaceae; a common Brazilian tree; `r round(mean(pd_no_out$mass.g.), 2)`g bromeliad ^-1^ ± `r round(sd(pd_no_out$mass.g.), 2)`, mean ± sd). In order to
track the effects of detrital decomposition on bromeliad N cycling, we enriched
these leaves with ^15^N by fertilizing five plants with 40ml pot^-1^ day^-1^ of 5g L^-1^ ammonium sulphate containing 10% atom excess of ^15^N. After 21 days we then collected *P. cauliflora* leaves,
air-dried until constant weight, and then soaked them for three days. This procedure removes excess nutrients from the artificial fertilization. Because some of our prey species consume fine detritus, not coarse, we also added a standard amount of dried fine detritus to our bromeliads (`r round(mean(pd_no_out$org_fine_mass, na.rm = TRUE), 2)`g bromeliad ^-1^ ± `r round(sd(pd_no_out$org_fine_mass, na.rm = TRUE), 2)`). We separated coarse and fine detritus by passing water from bromeliads through two sieves (as above for observational work, 150 and 850 µm). We defined "coarse detritus" as anything retained on the 850 µm sieve, and "fine detritus" as anything found on the 150 µm sieve.

Each bromeliad was stocked with a representative insect community (See supplementary material). The densities
of each prey taxon were calculated from the observational dataset (Hypothesis 1), using
data from bromeliads of similar size to those in our experiment. We ran this experiment in two temporal blocks for logistical reasons: three complete replicates of all treatments were set up on 20 February 2011, and two on 08 March 2011. We first placed the prey species into the bromeliad, allowed two days for the prey to adjust, then added predators. After 26 days from the beginning of each block, we added the same prey community a second time to simulate the continuous
oviposition that characterizes the system. We concluded the experiment 43 days from the first addition of prey (20 April 2011). Throughout the experiment, all bromeliads were enclosed
with a mesh cage topped with a malaise trap and checked daily for emergence of
adults. At the end of the experiment we completely dissected our bromeliads, collecting all invertebrates and detritus remaining inside.

We used a substitutive design, maintaining the same predator
metabolic capacity in all replicates (see below). In a substitutive experiment, all experimental units receive the same "amount" of predators -- usually standardized by abundance -- and only species composition varies. However, when species differ substantially in body
size - as in this experiment - abundance does not standardize the their effects on the community. We chose to standardize using metabolic capacity instead (after Srivastava [-@Srivastava2009a]). Integrating the allometric relationship between body size and feeding
rate [@Brown2004; @Wilby2005] over all individuals of a species allows estimates
of "metabolic capacity", or the potential energy requirements of a species
[@Srivastava2009a]. Metabolic capacity is equal to individual body
mass raised to the power of 0.69 (an invertebrate-specific exponent determined by Peters [-@Peters1986] for invertebrates and confirmed by Chown et al, [-@Chown2007]); this reflects the nonlinear relationship between feeding rate and body size across many invertebrate taxa. 

To quantify the effect of predators on ecosystem function, at the end of the experiment we measured five
community and ecosystem response variables: decomposition of coarse detritus,
production of fine particulate organic matter (FPOM),  bromeliad growth,
uptake of detrital nitrogen into bromeliad tissue, and survival of
invertebrate prey (emerged adults + surviving larvae). We measured decomposition by once again passing the bromeliad water through a 850 µm sieve, collecting the retained detritus and determining the mass of this detritus after oven-drying it at approximately 70$^\circ$C. We measured the
production of FPOM by taking the remaining liquid and filtering it on pre-weighed coffee filters, which were then dried and reweighed. We measured bromeliad growth as the average increase in length of five leaves per plant. We
tracked the uptake of labeled detrital nitrogen by analyzing three innermost
(closest to meristem) bromeliad leaves at the end of the experiment. Finally, we quantified the species
composition and survivorship of invertebrate prey by combining counts of
emerging adult insects and surviving larvae. 

We measured decomposition by collecting all _Plinia_ leaves from bromeliads; these
were oven-dried at 70$^\circ$C before their mass was determined. At the end of
experiment, we sampled three new bromeliad leaves for isotopic (^15^N) and
nitrogen concentration analyses. These analyses were performed at the Stable
Isotope Facility laboratory (UC Davis, CA, USA) using continuous flow isotope
ratio mass spectrometer (20-20 mass spectrometer; PDZ Europa, Sandbach,
England) after sample combustion to N~2~ at 1000C by an on-line elemental
analyzer (PDZ Europa ANCA-GSL).

## Data analysis

We quantified the effect of phylogenetic distance on each of distributional (Hypothesis 1) and diet (Hypothesis 2) similarity.  First, we calculated phylogenetic distance between each pair of species, then fit several functions to the relationship between phylogenetic diversity an either distributional or diet similarity. We used linear, constant, and several appropriate nonlinear functions (nonlinear, because our measures of similarity are bounded by 0 and 1; see below). We compared these models using AIC and generated confidence intervals as appropriate (parametric or bootstrap for linear and nonlinear, respectively). We evaluated both distributional and diet similarity between predators using Pianka's index of niche overlap [@Pianka1974]:

$O_{kl}=\dfrac{\sum_i^n{p_{il} p_{ik}}}{\sqrt{\sum_i^n{p_{il}^2} \sum_i^n{p_{ik}^2}}}$

For each pair of predators, $p_{ik}$ and $p_{il}$ represent the preference of
predator $k$ or $l$ for resource or habitat $i$. The value $O_{kl}$ represents similarity (in our case, in either distribution or diet) and ranges from 0 (complete dissimilarity) to 1 (complete similarity). The $n$ resources represent the different habitats surveyed for Hypothesis 1 (distributional similarity), or the different prey species assayed for Hypothesis 2 (diet similarity). Preference ($p_{ik}$) represents the proportion of a predator's total metabolic capacity found in a particular bromeliad (Hypothesis 1); or the 
proportion of feeding trials in which it ate a particular prey (Hypothesis 2). We also compared these effects via a Mantel test, to check for overall correlation between the phylogenetic distance matrix and dissimilarity in either predator distribution or diet preferences.

We divided the analysis of this experiment into three parts: quantifying the effect of phylogenetic distance on prey community similarity, on community and ecosystem responses, and on non-additive effects of predator combinations. First, we compared the four treatments with single predator species by calculating the similarity in species composition (Pianka's index) between surviving prey communities and relating this to the phylogenetic distance between predators with a linear regression. If predator feeding choices are phylogenetically conserved, that diet similarity will decline with increasing phylogenetic distance.

Second, we measured five community and ecosystem responses, testing in turn the effect of predator presence, number, species identity, and finally phylogenetic diversity. To test for an effect of predator presence, we compared the control treatment (predators absent) with the mean responses of all seven treatments that did contain predators. To test for an effect of predator species number (one or two predators), we compared the means of all single-species treatments with the means of all two-species treatments. To test for an effect of predator identity, we compared all four single-species treatments. Finally, to test for an effect of predator combinations we compared all two-species treatments (3 pairs total). We analyzed each of these of these orthogonal comparisons with one-way ANOVA. 

In our third and final analysis we quantified the non-additive effect of predator species on our responses. We calculated this effect as the difference between the
response in bromeliads with both predator species (n=5) and the mean response in bromeliads with either one of these two predator species 
(n=5 for each predator species).  We generated bootstrap confidence intervals for
these non-additive effects; confidence intervals that do not overlap zero
indicate a significant non-additive effect of a predator combination. We used R version 3.2.0 [@rcore] for most calculations, and two packages: picante [@picante] for calculating phylogenetic distances matrices, and vegan [@vegan] for distance metrics.

## Results

### Hypothesis 1: similarity in distribution
```{r CALC_metabolic_numbers}
## numbers for text:

  summarise(meanpred=mean(nspp),
            sdpred=signif(sd(nspp),2)) 

```

```{r TEST_metabolic~phylo}
meta_phylo_lm_summary <- lm(overlap~phylodistance, 
                            data = metabolic_occur_phylo) %>% 
  summary
```

```{r CALC_nodeages}
n.nodes <- nrow(nodeages)
nstudies <- sum(nodeages$nstudies)
```

We did not find any significant relationship between predator co-occurrence in bromeliads (measured as Pianka's index of niche overlap) and the phylogenetic distance between them (Figure 1a, `r F_text( meta_phylo_lm_summary)`).  This indicates that all `r metabolic$Taxa %>% unique %>% length` predator species have roughly similar habitat distributions at the level of the bromeliad. Indeed we often found multiple predator species co-occurring in the same bromeliads (mean `r nspp$meanpred` ± `r nspp$sdpred` predator species per plant). A Mantel test also found no evidence of correlation between differences among predators in habitat use, and phylogenetic distance (correlation `r sprintf("%.2f", meta_pd_mantel$statistic)`, p = `r sprintf("%.2f", meta_pd_mantel$signif)`, `r meta_pd_mantel$control$nperm` permutations). We were able to sample a wide range of phylogenetic relatedness, including two groups of congenerics -- two species of _Bezzia_ sp. (Diptera:Ceratopogonidae) and three species of _Leptagrion_ sp.
(Odonata:Coenagrionidae). There were also two groups of confamilials -- three species of
Tabanidae and two species of Empididae, all Diptera.  Deeper divisions were also present: three families of Diptera were represented by a single predator species each (Dolichopodidae, Corethrellidae and
Chironomidae) and the deepest taxonomic divide was between all insects present and the predatory leeches (Arhynchobdellida:Hirudinidae).

### Hypothesis 2: Similarity in diet

```{r CALC_diet_numbers}
## Diet numbers for text:

percentpredation <- feeding_trials %>%
  transform(percent.eaten = eaten/number.trials) %>%

            totaltrials = sum(number.trials),
            nprey = n())

  as.numeric()
```

```{r TEST_diet-sim_as_PD}

  lm(overlap~phylodistance, weights = nspp, data = .) %>%

dietmat <- diet_overlap_phylo %>%

```

```{r TEST_community-sim_as_PD}
exper_phylo_lm_summary <- experiment_phylo %>%
  #filter(nspp>1) %>%
  lm(overlap~phylodistance, weights = nspp, data = .) %>%
  summary()
```

Phylogenetically distant predators differed in their preference of prey
species, as measured by the niche overlap index (Fig 1b, regression weighted by the number of prey assayed, `r F_text(diet_phylo_lm_summary)`). However a Mantel test found no evidence of correlation between dissimilarity in diet and phylogenetic distance among predators (correlation `r sprintf("%.2f", diet_pd_mantel$statistic)`, p = `r sprintf("%.2f", diet_pd_mantel$signif)`, `r diet_pd_mantel$control$nperm` permutations).

### Hypothesis 3: similarity in top-down effects
```{r summarize_randos}
tab_nonadd <- subset(rando_pvals, response == "total.surv" & nonadd == "tab_non")[["rando_p"]]
leech_nonadd <- subset(rando_pvals, response == "total.surv" & nonadd == "leech_non")[["rando_p"]]
```

We analyzed our five univariate response variables from the manipulative experiment by dividing them into four separate and orthogonal tests: predator presence, predator number, predator species identity and, increasing predator phylogenetic diversity. Across all four tests, we saw the strongest responses for total prey survivorship (Table 1). Prey survivorship was halved when predators were present (Figure 2a, Table 1). Despite the decline in diet similarity with phylogenetic distance (Question 2), the variation in predator feeding behaviour did not translate into a significant differences in the composition of prey species surviving the manipulative experiment 
(Fig 1c, `r F_text(exper_phylo_lm_summary)`, distance measured as Bray-Curtis dissimilarity). Although single predator species had similar effects on survivorship (Figure 2c, Table 1), combinations of predators with higher phylogenetic diversity showed a significant increase in total prey survivorship (Fig 2d). That is, more phylogenetically diverse predator combinations caused less prey mortality.  Interestingly, these effects on prey surviorship did not result in a change in the processing of detritus (measured either as reduction in coarse detritus or production of fine detritus), bromeliad growth or nitrogen cycling (Table 1). 

We tested for non-additive effects of predator phylogenetic diversity with bootstrap confidence intervals. When we compared the actual effects of predator combinations with those expected from the mean of each single-species treatment, we found that predator pairs with the greatest phylogenetic diversity had the highest prey survival. Whereas effects of _L. andromache_ and _L. elongatum_ in combination
were quite similar to the effect of either alone, when _L. elongatum_ was
placed in the same plant as either a _Stibasoma_ larva or leeches, on average five
more prey individuals (18% of total prey community) survived till the end of
the experiment (Fig 3; Tabanid, p = `r tab_nonadd`, Leech, p = `r leech_nonadd`).  Once again, this effect on invertebrate density did not in turn create a significant difference in other response variables.

**Figure 1**: Phylogenetic distance between predators as a predictor of niche overlap among predators and impacts on prey composition. Our measures of niche overlap were: (a) distribution among bromeliads and  (b) diet preferences. We also show the effect of phylogenetic distance between predators on (c) community dissimilarity of surviving prey (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity). We measured distributional similarity (a) by counting all predators in 25 bromeliads, estimating their total metabolic capacity, and calculating niche overlap (Pianka's index) among all pairs of species. We measured diet preferences (b) for a subset of these predators by offering them various prey in no-choice trials, and again calculated niche overlap among them. Finally, we measured community composition of surviving prey (c) at the end of an experiment in which predators were placed in bromeliads with standardized prey communities. For (a) and (b) we used Pianka's index of niche overlap (1 = complete niche overlap) and tested various nonlinear and linear models (see Appendix) of the relationship between this index and phylogenetic distance. Solid lines show significant model fit, and dashed lines show bootstrap 95% quantiles.

**Figure 2**: Orthogonal comparisons of the effect of predators on prey survival. We show the effects of predator presence (a), and then within predator present treatments the effects of predator species number (b). Within treatments with one predator species, we show effects of predator identity (c). Within treatments with two predator species, we show the effect of increasing phylogenetic diversity (d, arranged in order of increasing phylogenetic distance: Low = _L. andromache_ + _L. elongatum_, Medium = _L. elongatum_ + tabanid, High = _L. elongatum_ + leech). Shaded dots represent grand means for each group; unshaded dots are either treatment means (2a and 2b, n = 5) or individual bromeliads (2c and 2d). Points are jittered horizontally slightly to reveal all datapoints.

**Figure 3**: Non-additive effects of predator combinations on prey decrease with increasing phylogenetic distance between predators. A difference of 0 indicates that two-predator treatments resulted in no more prey mortality than would be expected from simply averaging single-predator treatments. A negative difference indicates that two-predator treatments resulted in less mortality than expected. Error bars represent bootstrap 95% confidence intervals.


**Table 1** Predator diversity effects on community and ecosystem variables. We measured five community-level variables: total prey survival (both emerged adults and surviving larvae; see Figure 1), the breakdown of coarse detritus (decomposition), the production of fine particulate organic matter (FPOM), the cycling of nitrogen, and the growth of the bromeliad itself. We contrast treatments in our experimental design in four ways: comparing treatments with predators to those without ("Predator Presence"), contrasting predator species ("Identity"), comparing predator communities of 1 or 2 species ("Richness"), and considering the effects of phylogenetic distance between predators ("Pairwise PD").  Values are slope ±  standard error and \* = p < 0.05

## Discussion

We found that in our bromeliad system the phylogenetic distance between predators had variable importance. The phylogenetic distance between predators was unrelated to co-occurrence (Hypothesis 1). However, as phylogenetic distance between predator species increased, diet overlap decreased by 20% (Hypothesis 2). Interestingly, these
apparent diet preferences in the lab did not generate a difference in species composition of surviving prey in the field (Hypothesis  3a).  Greater phylogenetic diversity caused an increase in prey survival (i.e. a decrease in predation); phylogenetically distant pairs of predators that co-occurred in bromeliads had less impact on prey than expected from their performance in isolation (Hypothesis 3b).

### Phylogenetic distance and similarity in distribution

Phylogenetic distance between predators did not explain overlap in habitat distribution. This similarity
in distribution could be caused by two processes: low habitat variability
among bromeliads, or low variability in preference of predators for different habitats. A concurrent observational study (AAMMD, unpublished) showed that bromeliads vary widely in abiotic conditions, size, detritus
amount and prey community; therefore it seems unlikely that low patch
variation explains the lack of pattern. It appears instead that predators do
not possess any strong phylogenetically-conserved  preferences for different
habitat characteristics, showing instead very generalist habitat preferences.
This is not surprising, given that these organisms live in small, fluctuation-prone
habitats. As a group, predatory invertebrates in bromeliads do not show more sensitivity to bromeliad size or drought than other invertebrates  [@Amundrud2015]. The co-occurrence of predator species within bromeliads suggests that antagonistic interactions among predators do not limit species distributions. Additionally, it appears that predator species are able to co-occur in many different combinations, creating a range of phylogenetic
diversities within bromeliads. This suggests that the range of
phylogenetic diversity we tested in our experiment was realistic.

### Phylogenetic distance and similarity in diet

We observed a negative relationship between phylogenetic distance and overlap
in diet as measured by laboratory feeding trials. This suggests that there is a phylogenetic signal to predator feeding traits.  For example, damselflies are visual predators
that engulf prey whole using specialized mouthparts; they are gape-limited
and cannot eat prey that are too large. Leeches, in contrast, lack eyes but are
able to pierce prey and consume them without swallowing. Damselflies showed a
much stronger preference for culicid larvae than did leeches, whereas leeches
were slightly better able to kill and consume scirtids. Culicid larvae are free swimming in the water column, and are therefore easily captured by engulfing predators, whereas scirtid larvae crawl on surfaces and are difficult to remove. Although in this study such feeding traits are phylogenetically structured, in other studies functional traits can be more
important than phylogeny *per se* to a predator's diet: Moody [-@Moody1993] found
that unrelated decapod species which were morphologically similar were also
functionally similar. Similarly, Rezende et al. [-@Rezende2009] found that both body size and
phylogeny determined the food web "compartment" (shared predator-prey
interactions) of predators in a marine foodweb. 

### Phylogenetic distance and non-additive effects

We found that the presence of predators reduced prey survival, but that this
reduction was less for phylogenetically-diverse combinations of
predators. This was contrary to our hypothesis that more distant predators
would show an increase in prey capture via complementarity. *L. andromache*
did not produce an antagonistic (i.e. less than additive) effect in combination with *L. elongatum*, whereas the two
more phylogenetically diverse combinations (*L. elongatum* with the Tabanid or leech) did. _Leptagrion_ species may not distinguish between conspecifics and congenerics. In predicting a synergistic non-additive effect of predators, we were
imagining an outcome much like those reported by Nilsson et al. [-@Nilsson2006c]. They found that
stoneflies caused prey to move into habitats where fish predators could
consume them, increasing total predation (a synergistic effect, caused by a
phylogenetically distinct predator). Our results are more consistent with
those of  Finke and Denno [-@Finke2005], who found that combinations with two insect predators had a
higher per-capita effect on leafhopper prey than combinations with an insect and a
spider. That is, more phylogenetically diverse combinations of predators
showed less predation on lower trophic levels.

When _L. elongatum_ occurred with more distantly related predators, prey survivorship was greater than expected. This
non-additive effect may have been due to a reduction in predation by odonates in the presence of non-odonate predators.
Odonates have been shown to be sensitive to chemical cues [@Barry2014] or tactile cues [@Atwood2014] of potential predators, which
causes a decrease in feeding rate. For example, a different species of bromeliad damselfly -- _Mecistogaster modesta_ Selys -- reduces predation when it is housed with Dytiscid adults [@Atwood2014]. If there is a phylogenetic signal
to the chemical cues released by predators, individuals of one species might be unable to distinguish close relatives
(congenerics in our case) from conspecifics. One limitation of our approach is that all phylogenetic
diversity treatments contained one species in common, *Leptagrion elongatum*.
It is possible that this species is more sensitive to the presence of other
predators, and therefore shows a larger effect in combination than
would other species in this community.  However, this is the most common
predator in this community and our results indicate that its top-down effects
are likely to be frequently reduced by the presence of other predators. 

In our experiment we did not see any effect of predator presence, nor of
increasing predator phylogenetic diversity, on ecosystem function (defined here as Nitrogen cycling, detritus decomposition and bromeliad growth). This was
contrary to our predictions based on the results of Ngai and Srivastava [-@Ngai2006], who
found that adding predators to a community increased Nitrogen cycling. While we did observe differences in prey consumption, the resulting changes in detritivore density
did not cause differences in decomposition of detritus. This difference may be
due to leaf traits of the _restinga_ vegetation. In _restinga_ vegetation,
leaves are generally extremely tough and waxy, whereas in rainforests, leaves tend to
be softer -- with the result that, in _restinga_, invertebrates are unable to
consume leaves directly. Several lines of
evidence support this assertion. Romero and Srivastava [-@Romero2010]
studied the effects of the spider _Corinna_ gr. _rubripes_ (Corinnidae) on
bromeliad ecosystems. This spider has no effect on the composition of
detritivore communities, nor on decomposition rates, but increases nitrogen
content in bromeliads, probably by depositing feces or the carcasses of
terrestrial prey. This indicates that _restinga_ bromeliads may derive less of
their nitrogen from terrestrial detritus, but may benefit more from
terrestrial inputs. A separate experiment (GQ Romero, pers comm) supports the
hypothesis that lower decomposition in _restinga_ is due to plant traits. This
second experiment contrasted decomposition caused by invertebrates and
bacteria with that caused by bacteria alone (by comparing bagged detritus
enclosed in coarse vs fine mesh). The experiment used two species of detritus:
leaves from a rainforest tree, and leaves from a _restinga_ tree.
Invertebrates only caused an increase in decomposition for the rainforest
tree, not the _restinga_ tree.

In most natural communities, multiple predator species co-occur and often
simultaneously affect prey species. By combining an observational study,
laboratory trials, and a field experiment that controlled number and
phylogenetic diversity of predators we have shown that phylogenetic relatedness
of species can help predict some aspects of lower trophic level responses. An
approach based on phylogenetic diversity offers an organizing framework around
which to compare diverse datasets on the distribution, trophic interactions and
combined effect of multiple predator species, to predict the top-down effect of
diverse predator assemblages.
